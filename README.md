# Description
Our project somewhat acomplishes the goals of writing a command interpreter for a Korn shell-like command language in C using Lex and Yac running under Unix. Our project parses through command lines and executes some appropriate commands.
# Design

# Verification
Once someone has unzipped our project they can varify that the functionmality works as specified first do the command "make" to make all the required files for the shell and then do the command "./nutshell" to start the program. After this command "[nutshell]>>" will be on the screen and the user will be able to type their desired commands.
